Hello all, recently I participated in the open-access Accenture Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program with Forage. Where I worked as a data analyst to help an organization named “Social Buzz” to analyze their data and help them understand how they can leverage their massive amount of data.

**🌟Project Overview:**

Client’s Name: Social Buzz

**🌟Business problem:**

The client has reached a massive scale within recent years and does not have the resources internally to handle it.

**🌟My Job Role:**

I am the data analyst assigned to carry out analysis on the client's sample data sets, generate insights, prepare visualizations and prepare a presentation to the client.

**🌟 Tools used to carry out this project include:**

1. Microsoft Excel: This was used to clean the datasets and generate key insights into the datasets.

**🌟 During this experience I have learnt and applied my data analytics skills to:**

- Clean the client’s data and carry out data modelling in Microsoft Excel.
- Analyse the client’s data to highlight their top 5 content categories with the largest aggregate popularity.
- Prepare data visualizations on Tableau and carry out storytelling with data.
